**Planning Next Steps**

The user is asking for help with their TypeScript learning project, specifically involving a Next.js marketplace and CartContext code. They seem unsure about the next steps and perhaps need guidance on practical exercises. 

I can suggest integrating CartContext with components, enhancing type safety, and tackling potential edge cases. It might be useful to include functions, like deriving totals, clearing the cart, and counting items. I’ll consider organizing these tasks and potentially implementing them using the manage_todo_list tool for multi-step tasks.**Clarifying User Requests**

The user had previously mentioned not wanting generated code, but now they are asking for practical tasks and support when they feel stuck. They opened CartContext.tsx, which suggests they might be ready for specific next steps. 

I can recommend tasks like adding CartContext in layout.tsx, creating an AddToCart button, and improving types for better handling of localStorage. Additionally, I’d highlight enforcing stock bounds and providing examples. Since the instructions suggest using a plan tool for multi-step tasks, I'll create a to-do list while keeping in mind their earlier preferences against code generation.**Formulating a Plan of Action**

The environment instructions clearly say I should take action when I can, as the user expects useful help. There's a mention of "Azure MCP," but that's not relevant to my response. I need to avoid unnecessary mentions of the model name unless asked.

The user asked what to do next, so I can propose tasks and offer to implement upon approval. I should draft a plan using the manage_todo_list tool, focusing on small improvements. This may include code changes if the user is okay with it, and I need to make sure I communicate clearly.**Outlining Steps for Improvements**

First off, I think defining a shared Product type in a single file, like lib/types.ts, could help cut down on duplication. Next, I can wrap the app with the CartProvider in layout.tsx, which will be important for context.

I need to add some selectors to CartContext for total items and total price, include a clearCart function, and ensure localStorage parsing handles invalid cases gracefully. Adding `AddToCart.tsx` will help implement item addition, plus integrating a way to view the cart in the NavBar or on the page. I'll check the existing components to see what's there but plan to read the relevant files to confirm the implementation.**Confirming CartContext Usage**

I think the next step is to fetch some information to confirm how CartContext is used. I'll start by using grep_search to locate where CartContext appears in the project. This will help me decide what needs to be implemented.

My plan involves a tool preamble: "I'll quickly scan components to see cart usage." Then I'll call functions.grep_search for the 'CartContext' pattern throughout the workspace. After that, I’ll read the files for components like AddToCart.tsx, ProductCard.tsx, and layout.tsx to check for CartProvider and any useCart instances, so I can put together a solid plan.I'll quickly scan components to see how the cart context is used and plan next steps.
